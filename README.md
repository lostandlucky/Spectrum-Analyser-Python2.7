I updated Adafruit's FFT Spectrum Analyzer to us PyQt5 instead of PySide, so it is able to work with Anaconda out of the box.  (Although you still need to install pyserial: pip install pyserial)

This version still uses python 2.7 - although I will eventually make one that works with Pyhthon 3

Code in support of the ['FFT: Fun with Fourier Transforms' guide](http://learn.adafruit.com/fft-fun-with-fourier-transforms) on the [Adafruit learning system](http://learn.adafruit.com/).
